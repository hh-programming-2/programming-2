Programming 2 course starts on Tuesday 25.3.

Hi all!

I would like to welcome you all to the Programming 2 course starting on Tuesday 25.3. Our first session is at 11:00 - 13:45 (lunch break at 11:45 - 12:30) in classroom 4013.

Before the start of the course, I want to remind everyone about the course prerequisites. The course requires good basic Java programming skills in during the Programming 1 course. Without a passing grade from the Programming 1 course or similar skills, the course will require a lot of extra effort.

Before the first lesson, I encourage everyone to try to do the "Git installation and GitHub account" exercise in Moodle: https://hhmoodle.haaga-helia.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=3154290. It should take roughly 30 minutes and will make the first week go a lot smoother.

See you all in the first session!

Br. Kalle
