Programming 2 course starts on Tuesday 25.3.

Hi all!

I would like to welcome you all to the Software Development Project 1 course starting on Tuesday 25.3. Our first session is at 11:45 - 13:45 in class room 4013.

Before the first lesson, try to do the "Git installation and GitHub account" exercise in Moodle: https://hhmoodle.haaga-helia.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=3154290. It should take roughly 30 minutes and will make the first week go smoother.

See you all in the first session!

Br. Kalle
